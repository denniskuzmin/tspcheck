The basic idea is to connect optimal routes with optimal routes.
1. find closest pairs (CP)
2. remove any pair that has dot from closer pair
3. loop through each route by quadtree to find closest dot from another route and connect them by sibling points (needs more detailed explanation)
4. compare it with other pairs of routes and choose some kind shortest overroute.
5. repeat 3-4
